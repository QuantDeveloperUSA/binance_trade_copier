DEPLOYMENT FIX ATTEMPT - 2025-06-22
=================================

Fixed Issues:
1. Removed conflicting deploy-powershell.yml workflow
2. Updated deploy.yml to use inline commands instead of calling non-existent batch script
3. Simplified deployment process

This file should appear on VPS after successful deployment.
If you see this file on the VPS, the deployment is working correctly.

Deployment commands:
- cd /d C:\Users\Administrator\binance_trade_copier
- git pull origin main  
- taskkill /F /IM python.exe 2>nul
- timeout /t 3 /nobreak
- start /B python main.py

Expected result: Updated HTML titles showing "Binance Trade Copier"
