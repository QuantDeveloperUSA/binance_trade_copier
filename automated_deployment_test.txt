=========================================

This file was created to test the GitHub Actions automated deployment.

Test Details:
- Time: June 22, 2025
- Purpose: Verify GitHub Actions can deploy without RDP intervention

If you see this file on the VPS without manual intervention, 
the automated deployment is working perfectly!

GitHub Actions should:
1. Connect via SSH using stored keys
2. Run git pull origin main  
3. Stop existing Python process
4. Start new Python process
5. Update this file on VPS

Previous deployments required approval - make sure to approve this one too!
